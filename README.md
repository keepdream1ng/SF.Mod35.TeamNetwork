I called this project a TeamNetwork, because it was supposed to be Skillfactory project
for a team, but maybe I'm the only one who went so far out of 15 people in class)

During development, i made an effort to figure out Bootstrap 5 to have options for fast prototyping.
Also, I made this route for website: /TestingEnviroment
You can quickly create users on this page and log in as them. It's only available in development mode.

Here is [example](https://github.com/itinessity/AwesomeNetwork/tree/feature/module-part-3/AwesomeNetwork) provided by Skillfactory, to compare.
Maybe its bad on purpose, I had to do a lot of things differently.
